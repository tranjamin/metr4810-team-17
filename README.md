## Installation

Create a python virtual environment with
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate it somehow, and hope powershell isn't really annoying. For windows, run:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

Install the requirements using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
